    <h1>SALLY</h1>
    <p>My favourite pet is a Chihuahua called Sally</p>
    <p>I called her Sally after my best friend called Sally moved and we lost communication.</p>
    <p>Chihuahuas are the smallest breed recognized by some kennel clubs.</p>
    <p>It's named after the state of Chihuahua in Mexico.</p>

    <h2>Why i love Sally so much</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Chihuahuas have a cool history</strong></li>
      <p>Chihuahuas have an ancient legacy, dating back to their ancestor, the Techichi. People have loved these companion dogs since around 300 BC. According to popular legend, Chihuahuas are their mastersâ€™ guides into heaven.</p>
      <p>Since Sally is a Chihuahua i find that fact more interesting.</p>
      <li><strong>Sally has a perfect size</strong></li>
      <p>Sally is very petite, and can be carried anywhere.</p>
